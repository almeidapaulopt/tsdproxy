👋 Welcome to the TSDProxy documentation!

## What is TSDProxy?

TSDProxy is a Tailscale + Docker application that automatically creates a proxy to
virtual addresses in your Tailscale network based on Docker container labels.
It simplifies traffic redirection to services running inside Docker containers,
without the need for a separate Tailscale container for each service.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
TSPProxy just needs a label in a your new docker service and it will be automatically
created in your Tailscale network and the proxy will be ready to be used.

## Why another proxy?

TSDProxy was created to address the need for a proxy that can handle multiple services
without the need for a dedicated Tailscale container for each service, without configuring
virtual hosts in Tailscale network, without entry configuration in a proxy like Caddy/nginx.
