ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the TSDProxy documentation!

## What is TSDProxy?

TSDProxy is an application that automatically creates a proxy to
virtual addresses in your Tailscale network.
Easy to configure and deploy, based on Docker container labels or a simple proxy
list file.
It simplifies traffic redirection to services running inside Docker containers,
without the need for a separate Tailscale container for each service.

> [!NOTE]
> TSDProxy just needs a label in your new docker service or a proxy list file and
> it will be automatically created in your Tailscale network and the proxy will be
> ready to be used.

## Why another proxy?

TSDProxy was created to address the need for a proxy that can handle multiple services
without the need for a dedicated Tailscale container for each service and without configuring
virtual hosts in Tailscale network.
